Training Details (frozen_lake_train.py)
---------------------------------------
The agent was trained using the Q-learning algorithm on the 4x4 slippery map.

Hyperparameters:
- Episodes: 30,000
- Learning Rate (Alpha): Starts at 0.1. When epsilon decays to 0, it switches to 0.001 to fine-tune.
- Discount Factor (Gamma): 0.9
- Epsilon (Exploration Rate): Starts at 1.0 (100% exploration) and decays by 0.00005 per episode until it reaches 0.

Process:
1. Initialization: A Q-table of size 16x4 (16 states, 4 actions) is initialized with zeros.
2. Loop: For each episode:
   - The agent chooses an action using an epsilon-greedy strategy (random exploration vs. exploitation of Q-values).
   - The agent takes the action, observes the new state and reward.
   - The Q-value for the previous state-action pair is updated using the Bellman equation:
     Q(s,a) = Q(s,a) + alpha * (reward + gamma * max(Q(s',:)) - Q(s,a))
   - Epsilon is decayed.
3. Output:
   - The final Q-table is saved to frozen_lake4x4.pkl.
   - A plot of cumulative rewards is saved to frozen_lake4x4_training.png.

Results
-------
The training process aims to maximize the win rate. The frozen_lake4x4_training.png shows the learning curve, where an upward trend indicates the agent is learning to reach the goal more frequently.

Evaluation Results:
Total Wins: 732
Win Rate: 73.20% (over 1000 episodes)

Standard Benchmark:
The environment is considered "solved" when the agent achieves a win rate of approximately 78% (0.78) over 100 episodes.
Our current agent (73.20%) is performing very well, approaching the solved threshold.
